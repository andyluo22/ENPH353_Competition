# ENPH353_Competition

The competition script for the robot is labelled competition_script.py.  The master node contains all the historical updates and modifications of the code.  In competition_script.py and importantly DOXYGEN comments were added for each function.  Thank you for the great semester, still not sure why my computer kept shutting down during the competition :(.
