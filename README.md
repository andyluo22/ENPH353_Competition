# ENPH353_Competition

The competition script for the robot is labelled competition_script.py.  The master node contains all the historical updates and modifications of the code.  In competition_script.py and importantly **DOXYGEN** comments were added for each function.  Thank you for the great semester, still not sure why my computer kept shutting down during the competition :(.

Here are also our** scripts** for training the driving and plate models:
